All about myself

Magandang Buhay! I am Rachelle Pamintuan, 33 years old, from Magalang, Pampanga.
I am now 11 years for this profession. I taught in private school for 2 years, and 9 years and counting in public school. I graduated in my Masteral Degree in 2013. 
I really love teaching since then, this made me decided to took the course of Education. 

I am presently teaching at San Roque Elementary School, grade 6 adviser. 
In my class I am strict just to impose discipline and get respect from my pupils. 
But I am also there BIG sister, who is ready to listem to them and a shoilder to lean on. I just want to seperate personal relationship 
With them.
